## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Minor Issues
- [ ] Some unit tests failing (22 failures) - non-critical, mostly mock-related
- [ ] E2E tests need data-testid attributes in components
- [ ] Performance monitor only works in Chromium browsers with memory API

### Limitations
- [ ] Single-server deployment (no clustering)
- [ ] SQLite database (not suitable for high concurrency)
- [ ] No message encryption (messages stored in plain text)
- [ ] No file transfer capability
- [ ] No group chat functionality

## 🔄 Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Pre-Production)
1. **Fix remaining unit tests** - Update mocks and test data
2. **Add data-testid attributes** - Complete E2E test coverage
3. **Security audit** - Review authentication and input validation
4. **Load testing** - Test with multiple concurrent users

### Short Term (Post-Launch)
1. **Database migration** - Move to PostgreSQL for production
2. **Message encryption** - Implement end-to-end encryption
3. **File transfer** - Add image and file sharing
4. **Mobile app** - React Native or PWA optimization

### Long Term
1. **Clustering support** - Multi-server deployment
2. **Group chat** - Multi-user chat rooms
3. **Voice/Video** - WebRTC integration
4. **Advanced features** - Screen sharing, emoji reactions
